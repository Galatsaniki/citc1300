            <h1>Struggling to Stay Awake? Learn How Sleep Deprivation Affects You.</h1>

            <p>Sleep is essential for both mental and physical health, yet millions of people suffer from <a
                    href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23970-sleep-deprivation" target="_blank">sleep
                    deprivation</a> every day. Whether it’s due to stress, lifestyle choices, or medical conditions,
                missing out
                on sleep can have serious consequences.</p>

            <h2>What is Sleep Deprivation?</h2>
            <p>Sleep deprivation happens when you don’t get enough rest to meet your body’s needs. Most adults need 7 to
                9 hours of sleep per night to stay healthy. However, many people fall short due to busy schedules, work,
                or stress. Lifestyle factors, like late nights or excessive screen time, can also contribute to sleep
                loss. Over time, even small sleep deficits can build up and affect your well-being. Prioritizing rest is
                key to feeling your best both mentally and physically.</p>

            <h3>Why Sleep Matters</h3>
            <p>When you get enough rest, your body has time to recover and repair itself. Sleep plays a vital role in
                maintaining your physical health, from regulating hormones to boosting your immune system. It also
                allows your brain to process information and strengthen memory. Without adequate rest, focus and
                concentration can suffer. Proper sleep helps stabilize your mood and reduce stress. Overall, getting
                enough sleep is essential for feeling energized, productive, and healthy.</p>
