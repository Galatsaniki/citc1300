            <h1>Why Sleep Needs Vary by Age</h1>
            <div>
                <p id="sleepNeedPara">Sleep is essential at every stage of life, but the amount and quality of sleep
                    required change as we
                    grow
                    older. Babies need significantly more sleep to support rapid brain development, while adults need
                    consistent rest to maintain overall health and cognitive function. As we age, sleep patterns
                    naturally
                    shift, and certain age groups may experience unique sleep challenges. Understanding these
                    differences
                    can help improve sleep quality for every stage of life.</p>
